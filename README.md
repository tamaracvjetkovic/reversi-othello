# Using the Application ⚙️

To use this application, follow the next steps:
1) clone this repo,
2) open the project in a Python IDE,
3) run the program

> NOTE: since this is a console application and it prints symbols, the visual design will vary depending on which OS you run it on. The project was done in Visual Studio Code on Windows, so the table will look clean if you run it from there, but it will probably break or look uneven on any other OS.

# Examples 💡

You choose black or white color and start playing (you always make the first move). You choose one of the free cells which you want by typing in one of given numbers on the table.
